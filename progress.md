## 2026-07-08 - TASK-001 - Main window UI and launch lifecycle

- What changed: Added Loop project docs, replaced the placeholder window with a multi-section SwiftUI shell, made the main window launch automatically, and kept the app alive in the menu bar after closing the window.
- Files touched: `AGENTS.md`, `project-analysis.md`, `roadmap.md`, `contract.md`, `progress.md`, `trace.md`, `loop.md`, `verification.md`, `CleanMac/CleanMacApp.swift`, `CleanMac/Models/CleanMacModels.swift`, `CleanMac/Views/*`, `CleanMacCore/Sources/CleanMacCore/CleanMacCore.swift`.
- Checks run: `swift test --package-path CleanMacCore`; `./script/build_and_run.sh --verify`; `pgrep -x CleanMac`; `osascript` window check before and after closing `Dashboard`.
- Result: Passed. The app launched with a `Dashboard` window, and the process stayed alive after the window was closed.
- Next step: TASK-002 read-only cleanup scanner.
- Bottleneck: implementation
- Handoff: The UI is intentionally non-destructive. The disabled cleanup action should remain disabled until real scan results and confirmation logic exist.

## Handoff

- Current state: TASK-001 complete. CleanMac now has a main UI shell and correct menu bar lifecycle.
- Next recommended task: Implement TASK-002 read-only cleanup scanner.
- Known blockers: local Xcode reports a CoreSimulator warning, but macOS app builds are not blocked.
- Commands that passed: `swift test --package-path CleanMacCore`; `./script/build_and_run.sh --verify`.
- Commands that failed: none in this loop yet.
- Current bottleneck: implementation
